									The greatest Obstacle to Enlightenment
								</a>
							</li>
								<p style="font-size:30px">	Enlightenment - what is that?<br>
									A beggar had been sitting by the side of a road for over thirty years. One day a
									stranger walked by. "Spare some change?" mumbled the beggar, mechanically
									holding out his old baseball cap. "I have nothing to give you," said the stranger. Then
									he asked: "What's that you are sitting on?" "Nothing," replied the beggar. "Just an old
									box. I have been sitting on it for as long as I can remember." "Ever looked inside?"
									asked the stranger. "No," said the beggar. "What's the point? There's nothing in
									there." "Have a look inside," insisted the stranger. The beggar managed to pry open
									the lid. With astonishment, disbelief, and elation, he saw that the box was filled with
									gold.<br>	
									I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look
									inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside
									yourself.<br>
									"But I am not a beggar," I can hear you say.<br>
									I love the Buddha's simple definition of enlightenment as "the end of suffering."
									The Buddha is silent on that, and his silence implies
									that you'll have to find out for yourself. He uses a negative definition so that the mind
									cannot make it into something to believe in or into a superhuman accomplishment, a
									goal that is impossible for you to attain<br>
									What is the greatest obstacle to experiencing this reality?<br>
									Identification with your mind, which causes thought to become compulsive. Not
									to be able to stop thinking is a dreadful affliction, but we don't realize this because
									almost everybody is suffering from it, so it is considered normal. This incessant
									mental noise prevents you from finding that realm of inner stillness that is inseparable
									from Being. It also creates a false mind-made self that casts a shadow of fear and
									suffering.<br>Identification with your mind creates an opaque screen of concepts, labels,
									images, words, judgments, and definitions that blocks all true relationship. It comes
									between you and yourself, between you and your fellow man and woman, between
									you and nature, between you and God.<br>

								</a>
							</li>
								<p style="font-size:30px">
									Many people live with a tormentor in their head that continuously
									attacks and punishes them and drains them of vital energy. It is the cause of untold
									misery and unhappiness, as well as of disease.<br>The good news is that you can free yourself from your mind. This is the only
									true liberation.Start listening to the voice in
									your head as often as you can. listen to the voice in your head, be there as the witnessing presence.<br>You'll soon realize: there is the
									voice, and here I am listening to it, watching it. This I am realization, this sense of
									your own presence, is not a thought. It arises from beyond the mind.<br>compulsive thinking. When a thought subsides, you experience a discontinuity in the
									mental stream - a gap of "no-mind." At first, the gaps will be short, a few seconds
									perhaps, but gradually they will become longer. When these gaps occur, you feel a
									certain stillness and peace inside you.<br>As you go more deeply into this realm of no-mind, as it is sometimes called in
									the East, you realize the state of pure consciousness. In that state, you feel your own
									presence with such intensity and such joy that all thinking, all emotions, your
									physical body, as well as the whole external world become relatively insignificant in
									comparison to it. And yet this is not a selfish but a selfless state. It takes you beyond
									what you previously thought of as "your self."<br>learn
									to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the
									light of your consciousness grows stronger. One day you may catch yourself smiling
									at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that
									you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self
									does not depend on it.<br>

								<a id="SH3">Enlightenment: Rising above Thought</a>	
							</li>
								<p style="font-size:30px">Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when
									the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of
									most people's thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its
									dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your
									mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy.<br>Why should we be addicted to thinking?<br>Because you are identified with it, which means that you derive your sense of self
									from the content and activity of your mind.
									Because you believe that you would cease to be if you stopped thinking. As you
									grow up, you form a mental image of who you are, based on your personal and
									cultural conditioning. We may call this phantom self the ego. It consists of mind
									activity and can only be kept going through constant thinking. The term ego means
									different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created
									by unconscious identification with the mind.<br>The mind is essentially a survival machine. Attack and defense against other
									minds, gathering, storing, and analyzing information - this is what it is good at, but it
									is not at all creative.<br>The more we learn about the workings of the body, the
									more we realize just how vast is the intelligence at work within it and how little we
									know. When the mind reconnects with that, it becomes a most wonderful tool. It then
									serves something greater than itself.<br>

								<a id="SH4">Emotion: The Body's Reaction to Your Mind</a>	
							</li>	
							<p style="font-size:30px">What about emotions? I get caught up in my emotions more than I do in my mind.
								Mind, in the way I use the word, is not just thought. It includes your emotions as well
								as all unconscious mental-emotional reactive patterns. Emotion arises at the place
								where mind and body meet. It is the body's reaction to your mind - or you might say,
								a reflection of your mind in the body. For example, an attack thought or a hostile
								thought will create a build-up of energy in the body that we call anger. The body is
								getting ready to fight. The thought that you are being threatened, physically or
								psychologically, causes the body to contract, and this is the physical side of what we
								call fear. Research has shown that strong emotions even cause changes in the
								biochemistry of the body. These biochemical changes represent the physical or
								material aspect of the emotion. Of course, you are not usually conscious of all your
								thought patterns, and it is often only through watching your emotions that you can
								bring them into awareness.<br>Conflict between surface thoughts and unconscious mental processes is certainly
								common. You may not yet be able to bring your unconscious mind activity into
								awareness as thoughts, but it will always be reflected in the body as an emotion, and
								of this you can become aware. To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same
								as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is
								that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and
								so is primarily felt in the body. You can then allow the emotion to be there without
								being controlled by it. You no longer are the emotion; you are the watcher, the
								observing presence. If you practice this, all that is unconscious in you will be brought
								into the light of consciousness.<br>Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is to say as long
								as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. I am talking here primarily of emotional
								pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease. Resentment,
								hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest
								irritation, are all forms of pain. And every pleasure or emotional high contains within
								itself the seed of pain: its inseparable opposite, which will manifest in time.
								Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get "high" will know that the high eventually
								turns into a low, that the pleasure turns into some form of pain. Many people also
								know from their own experience how easily and quickly an intimate relationship can
								turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain. Seen from a higher perspective,
								both the negative and the positive polarities are faces of the same coin, are both part
								of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the mind-identified egoic state of
								consciousness.<br>
								There are two levels to your pain: the pain that you create now, and the pain from the
								past that still lives on in your mind and body. Ceasing to create pain in the present
								and dissolving past pain - this is what I want to talk about now.

									Create No More Pain In The Present	
								</a>
							</li>	
								<p style="font-size:30px">Nobody's life is entirely free of pain and sorrow. Isn't it a question of learning to live
															with them rather than trying to avoid them?<br>
															The greater part of human pain is unnecessary. It is self created as long as the
															unobserved mind runs your life.<br>
															The pain that you create now is always some form of non acceptance, some form of
															unconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance is some
															form of judgment. On the emotional level, it is some form of negativity. The intensity
															of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment, and this in turn
															depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind. The mind always seeks
															to deny the Now and to escape from it. In other words, the more you are identified
															with your mind, the more you suffer. Or you may put it like this: the more you are
															able to honor and accept the Now, the more you are free of pain, of suffering - and
															free of the egoic mind.<br>The present moment is sometimes unacceptable, unpleasant, or awful.<br>
															It is as it is. Observe how the mind labels it and how this labeling process, this
															continuous sitting in judgment, creates pain and unhappiness. By watching the
															mechanics of the mind, you step out of its resistance patterns, and you can then allow
															the present moment to be. This will give you a taste of the state of inner freedom
															from external conditions, the state of true inner peace. Then see what happens, and
															take action if necessary or possible.<br>
															Accept - then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had
															chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your
															enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.<br><a href="TOC.html">See contents</a>

									Past Pain: Dissolving The Pain-Body
								</a>
							</li>	
								<p style="font-size:30px">As long as you are unable to access the power of the Now, every emotional pain that
															you experience leaves behind a residue of pain that lives on in you. It merges with the
															pain from the past, which was already there, and becomes lodged in your mind and
															body. This, of course, includes the pain you suffered as a child, caused by the
															unconsciousness of the world into which you were born.<br>This accumulated pain is a negative energy field that occupies your body and mind. If
															you look on it as an invisible entity in its own right, you are getting quite close to the
															truth. Its the emotional pain-body. It has two modes of being: dormant and active. A
															pain-body may be dormant 90 percent of the time; in a deeply unhappy person,
															though, it may be active up to 100 percent of the time. Some people live almost
															entirely through their pain-body, while others may experience it only in certain
															situations, such as intimate relationships, or situations linked with past loss or
															abandonment, physical or emotional hurt, and so on. Anything can trigger it,
															particularly if it resonates with a pain pattern from your past. When it is ready to
															awaken from its dormant stage, even a thought or an innocent remark made by
															someone close to you can activate it.<br>Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illusion, and this is true.
															The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn't make it true. Do you want to
															experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does
															that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can realize
															this truth - that is, make it real in your own experience.<br>
															So the pain-body doesn't want you to observe it directly and see it for what it is. The
															moment you observe it, feel its energy field within you, and take your attention into
															it, the identification is broken. A higher dimension of consciousness has come in. I
															call it presence. You are now the witness or the watcher of the pain-body. This means
															that it cannot use you anymore by pretending to be you, and it can no longer replenish
															itself through you. You have found your own innermost strength. You have accessed
															the power of Now.<br><a href="TOC.html">See contents</a>

									Ego Identification With The Pain-Body
								</a>
							</li>	
									<p style="font-size:30px">The process that I have just described is profoundly powerful yet simple. It could be
																taught to a child, and hopefully one day it will be one of the first things children learn
																in school. Once you have understood the basic principle of being present as the
																watcher of what happens inside you - and you "understand" it by experiencing it -
																you have at your disposal the most potent transformational tool.<br>
																This is not to deny that you may encounter intense inner resistance to disidentifying
																from your pain. This will be the case particularly if you have lived closely identified
																with your emotional pain-body for most of your life and the whole or a large part of
																your sense of self is invested in it. What this means is that you have made an unhappy
																self out of your pain-body and believe that this mind-made fiction is who you are. In
																that case, unconscious fear of losing your identity will create strong resistance to any
																disidentification. In other words, you would rather be in pain –be the pain-body–
																than take a leap into the unknown and risk losing the familiar unhappy self.
																If this applies to you, observe the resistance within yourself. Observe the attachment
																to your pain. Be very alert. Observe the peculiar pleasure you derive from being
																unhappy. Observe the compulsion to talk or think about it. The resistance will cease
																if you make it conscious. You can then take your attention into the pain-body, stay
																present as the witness, and so initiate its transmutation.<br>
																Only you can do this. Nobody can do it for you. But if you are fortunate enough to
																find someone who is intensely conscious, if you can be with them and join them in
																the state of presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things. In this way, your
																own light will quickly grow stronger. When a log that has only just started to burn is
																placed next to one that is burning fiercely, and after a while they are separated again,
																the first log will be burning with much greater intensity. After all, it is the same fire.
																To be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher. Some therapists may
																also be able to fulfill that function, provided that they have gone beyond the level of
																mind and can create and sustain a state of intense conscious presence while they are
																working with you.<br><a href="TOC.html">See contents</a>

							<li style="font-size:30px; color:blue">
								<a id="SH9">
									The Origin Of Fear
								</a>
							</li>	
									<p style="font-size:30px">The reason why you don't put your hand in the fire is not because of fear, it's because
																you know that you'll get burned. You don't need fear to avoid unnecessary danger -
																just a minimum of intelligence and common sense. For such practical matters, it is
																useful to apply the lessons learned in the past. Now if someone threatened you with
																fire or with physical violence, you might experience something like fear. This is an
																instinctive shrinking back from danger, but not the psychological condition of fear
																that we are talking about here. The psychological condition of fear is divorced from
																any concrete and true immediate danger. It comes in many forms: unease, worry,
																anxiety, nervousness, tension, dread, phobia, and so on. This kind of psychological
																fear is always of something that might happen, not of something that is happening
																now. You are in the here and now, while your mind is in the future. This creates an
																anxiety gap. And if you are identified with your mind and have lost touch with the
																power and simplicity of the Now, that anxiety gap will be your constant companion.
																You can always cope with the present moment, but you cannot cope with something
																that is only a mind projection - you cannot cope with the future.<br>
																Moreover, as long as you are identified with your mind, the ego runs your life, as I
																pointed out earlier. Because of its phantom nature, and despite elaborate defense
																mechanisms, the ego is very vulnerable and insecure, and it sees itself as constantly
																under threat. This, by the way, is the case even if the ego is outwardly very confident.
																Now remember that an emotion is the body's reaction to your mind. What message is
																the body receiving continuously from the ego, the false, mind-made self? Danger, I
																am under threat. And what is the emotion generated by this continuous message?
																Fear, of course.<br>
																Fear seems to have many causes. Fear of loss, fear of failure, fear of being hurt, and
																so on, but ultimately all fear is the ego's fear of death, of annihilation. To the ego,
																death is always just around the corner. In this mind-identified state, fear of death
																affects every aspect of your life. For example, even such a seemingly trivial and
																"normal" thing as the compulsive need to be right in an argument and make the other
																person wrong - defending the mental position with which you have identified - is due
																to the fear of death. If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong,
																your mind-based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation. So you as the
																ego cannot afford to be wrong. To be wrong is to die. Wars have been fought over
																this, and countless relationships have broken down.<br>So anyone who is identified with their mind and, therefore, disconnected from their
																true power, their deeper self rooted in Being, will have fear as their constant
																companion. The number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet extremely
																small, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or know lives in a state of
																fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluctuates between anxiety and dread at one end
																of the scale and a vague unease and distant sense of threat at the other. Most people
																become conscious of it only when it takes on one of its more acute forms.<br><a href="TOC.html">See contents</a>
